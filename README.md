In this study, we are interested in the behavior of a logarithmic model for the Weibull law applied to the fi nancial data of the French index of the CAC 40. 

First of all, our goal is to detect the point for which the model tends to change its distribution law. This point is called the breaking point.

Then, we perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to verify the relevance of the model established on our data, i.e. to see if there is a signifi cant break in the law of the model or not. 

To do this, we propose two methods, the first is based on the maximization of the log likelihood and the second is an analytical method which consists in linearizing the distribution function of the Weibull law.
